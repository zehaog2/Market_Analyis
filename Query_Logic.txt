Relative Volume = Today's Vol / avg(daily vol over past 30 days)
Relative Volume (interval = 1day) < 1
  ensures volume is subdued as the pattern builds

Volume-Weighted Avg Price < Price

Shows that today’s activity is skewed to buys—institutions often chase prices above VWAP. It confirms the EMAs (10/20/50) stack isn’t just a fluke but is backed by real money flow.
Optional:
Volume-Weighted Moving Avg (20) < Price
weights by volume instead of decay
Gives you a trend line that reacts to where big blocks traded. A breakout above VWMA tells you the big players are on board.

Optional:
Relative Volume at Time = current vol / SMA(vol, N periods)
Use when volume patterns don't vary much intraday
