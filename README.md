### ðŸ“ˆ Fear & Greed Details

#### Maths

The sentiment score (0-100) is calculated using: (adjust weight to your own liking please)
- **Price Momentum** (40%): Recent price performance
- **RSI** (30%): Relative Strength Index
- **Volume Analysis** (20%): Volume vs average
- **Volatility** (10%): Market volatility (inverse relationship)

#### Data Sources

- **Market Data**: Yahoo Finance API (yfinance)
- **Sector ETFs**: SPDR Sector ETFs (XLK, XLF, XLV, etc.)
- **Updates**: Real-time during market hours

## Improvements I might work on:
- I am considering setting up a dashboard to check my historical trades, aka visualizing my glory and failures.

## Suggested usage
-Not developed for day traders, option trading, or short-selling. Focus on the most basic: buying the stocks of growth companies. Can always replace anchor "SPY" with your favorite ETF. Complement short to mid term investment strategies, narrow down queries & help risk management.
