# TradingView Stock Query Logic

Step1: 
EMA10 > EMA20 > EMA50: geometry-of-averages check, a "stacked" trend

Price > EMA50: price vs trend, breakout/confirmation check

Step: 
Relative Volume = Today's Vol / avg(daily vol over past 30 days)
Relative Volume (interval = 1day) > 1.2
Requires a 20% increase in activity

Volume-Weighted Avg Price < Price

Shows that today’s activity is skewed to buys—institutions often chase prices above VWAP. It confirms the EMAs (10/20/50) stack isn’t just a fluke but is backed by real money flow.
Optional:
Volume-Weighted Moving Avg (20) < Price
weights by volume instead of decay
Gives you a trend line that reacts to where big blocks traded. A breakout above VWMA tells you the big players are on board.

Optional:
Relative Volume at Time = current vol / SMA(vol, N periods)
Use when volume patterns don't vary much intraday


Step: 
Manual Order block confirmations
